\section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Purpose}
		This SRS describes the requirements and specifications of the AgBizClimate\texttrademark web application. This document will explain the functional features of this web application. This includes the interface details, design constraints and considerations such as performance characteristics. This SRS is intended out outline how we will proceed with the development of the AgBizClimate\texttrademark system.
		\end {Purpose}
		
		\subsection{Scope}
			This project is a part of a much larger AgBizLogic program. However, the purpose of this project is to add a short term climate tool to the AgBizClimate module. This limits the scope of the project to the AgBizClimate Module. Additionally, we will only be adding the short term climate data tool as the long term climate data tool already exists.
		\end{Scope}
		
		\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
			RESTFUL API-
			NWCTB - Northwest Climate Toolbox. This is the database we will be connecting to that will provide the short term climate data we plan to use.
			Climate Scenario - This is a theoretical calculation of yields, inputs and of the overall budget for one situation based on the climate data.
			SQL Database - This is a relational database that makes storing and accessing data easy.
		\end{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
		
		\subsection{References}
			Here we will need to pace a reference to the NWCTB documentation. We may also want to place a reference to existing AgBizClimate docs.
			We will also need a reference to our problem statement.
		\end{References}
		
		\subsection{Overview}
			Seasonal climate is one of the essential factors that affects harvest, returns of crops and farming investment programs of enterprises and organizations. As a sub-project of AgBizLogic, AgBizClimate is dedicated to deliver essential information about climate change to farmers, and help professionals to develop management pathways that best fit their operations under a changing climate. This project aims to link the crucial seasonal climate data from the Northwest Climate Toolbox database to AgBizLogic so that it can provide specific analysis and illustrations through powerful graphics. AgBizClimate is designed to enable farmers and agriculture enterprises to decide appropriate farming investment projects for their crops and products.\\
    Currently AgBizClimate has a long-term climate tool but no such tool exists for short term climate data. We will implement a tool to extract short-term climate data from the Northwest Climate Toolbox database, display it to the user and allow the user to adjust crop yields, inputs and costs. Moreover, a landing tool will be developed to allow users to switch between short term seasonal tool and long-term climate data tool.\\
		\end{Overview}
\end {Introduction}
\section{Overall Description}
	\subsection {Product Functions}
				AgBizClimate is a web based decision tool that will allow users to gain specific insight on how localized climate data for the next seven months will affect their costs and net returns. The AgBizClimate tool will allow users to input their location (state, county) and the budget for the specific crop they are trying to farm. AgBizClimate will then grab the climate data for the next seven months for that location and provide graphical data showing temperature and precipitation. Users will then be able to input the percentage they think these factors will affect their crops. Finally the tool will adjust for these factors and provide final estimates on the projected yield and production back to the user.
	\end
	
	\subsection{User Characteristics}
		AgbizClimate users can be split into two subgroups, agricultural producers and climate researchers. The first subgroup, agricultural users who use this product tend to be between fifty and sixty years old of mixed gender. Their educational background rangers from none to the completion of college. The primary language this group uses is English, but there are some Spanish users as well. Most of the users in this group tend to have novice computational skills. The primary domain for these users is agricultural and business management. Most agricultural producers who use this product are motivated by the potential profit that the decision service AgBizClimate could potentially offer. The second subgroup, climate researchers range from ages twenty to forty and are of mixed gender. The educational background for most climate researchers  exceed the postgraduate level with their primary language being English. These users generally have advanced computational skills and are motivated by the easily accessible climate and weather data.
	\end{User Characteristics}
	
	\subsection{Constraints}
		There are several key constraints that this product has to work within. The first constraint is that we only have access to two data parameters from the North West Climate Tool box, precipitation and temperature. Secondly, we only have access to their data via the NWCTB API which could have additional restrictions such as limited usage per day, mislabeled data, or poor documentation. Thirdly, we donâ€™t have access to any of the hardware that AgBizClimate is exists on as it is being managed by a third party. This will prevent us from improving the hardware or cause roadblocks if their servers are having issues. Lastly, we are limited to using the languages Python and JavaScript since we are integrating our product into an already existing project.
	\end{Constraints}
	
	\subsection {Assumptions and Dependencies}
		We are assuming that the Northwest Climate Toolbox is a functional API that will allow us to pull location based temperature and precipitation data. This data will most likely come in the form of a text body of which we will then format into a JSON object and store in a Mongo database for future use. Due to the fact that we are writing an addition to an existing project we do not need to interact with the user budgets as these have already been defined. This fact extends to the calculations portion of the AgBizClimate product. Our team will simply be accessing data via the NWCT API, then format the data, store the data, and hand the data over to the tool while will provide some additional front end support.
	\end{Assumptions and Dependencies}
	
\end {Overall Description}

\section{Specific Requirements}
This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the AgBizClimate System. We will give detailed description of what's being added to the AgBizLogic system along with the features we will implement.
    \subsection{External Interface Requirements}
		This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the short term climate tool for the AgBizClimate system. This section will also provide descriptions for the hardware, software and communication interfaces. Additionally we will provide detailed prototypes for the user interface for the short term climate data tool.
        \subsubsection{User Interface}
					When the user first navigates to AgBizClimate from the AgBizLogic main page the user will be directed to a landing page. This landing page will allow the user to either select the existing long term climate tool or the short term climate tool that we will be developing. On this page there will be a brief description of the tool and what does. This description will also describe the difference between the long term climate data tool and the short term data climate tool. Below this description will be two buttons one to run the long term climate data tool and one to run the short term climate data tool. Clicking the long term climate data tool button will take you to the long term climate data tool page. Clicking the short term climate data tool button will take you to the short term climate data tool page. A prototype of this page is shown below in figure 3.1 (Not yet available)//
					
					After clicking on the short term climate data tool page you will be directed to a page that will allow you to create a new climate scenario. This page will allow the user to chose which budgets they would like to adjust and make notes about this scenario. This page also allows them to cancel or delete the scenario they are currently working on. A prototype for this page is shown below in figure 3.2 (Not yet available)//
					
					Once the user Selects their budgets, makes notes on the scenario and clicks continue the will be redirected to a page where they will be prompted to enter their location. This page will take a county and a sate as input. This page will have a drop down menu for the state and the county. Before the user can enter a County they will be forced to enter a state. Once a state is entered the county drop down menu will auto populate and the user will be allowed to enter a county. A prototype of this page is shown below in figure 3.3 (Not yet available)\\
					
					After clicking continue the user will be taken to the plots for the location they selected. This page will initially have the 7 month average precipitation plot selected as the default. However, the user can select from four options via a drop down menu. Changing what is selected in the drop down menu will change which plot is displayed. Once the user has reviewed the plots they can then enter in how much they think their yield will be effected based on the climate data. A prototype of this page is shown below in figure 3.4 (Not yet available)\\
					
					Next the user will be directed to the budget review page. This page will display a summary of the budget. The summary of the budget will include Income, General Cash Costs and A total summary of the budget. This page will allow the user to adjust the cost per unit, input costs, and quantity sold and will adjust their budget in near real time. This page will also allow the user to remove or add inputs to their general costs. This page will also allow the user to save their budget and output it as a PDF. A prototype of this page is shown below in figure 3.5 (Not yet available)\\					
					
        \end{User Interface}

        \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
					This project requires no designed hardware and the hardware this system is running on is managed by the Operating system as a result no hardware interfaces are necessary. Additionally the connection the the NWCTB is managed over the network and requires no hardware interface.
        \end{Hardware Interface}

        \subsubsection{Software Interface}
					There are several software interfaces in this application, one between the back end and the front end, one between the back end and the Database and finally a software interface between our RESTFUl API and the NWCTB. The majority of the connections between the front end and the back end are managed for us the the current AgBizLogic system. However, we will still need to connect our API to the back end to provide the data from the NWCTB. To make this connection we will use a RESTFULL API. This will allow for the back end code to make a direct call to our API to extract the data.
					We will also need a connection between the NWCTB and our API. At the time of writing this document we have not received any information from the NWCTB regarding the API they have promised access too. However, We do know that we will need to authenticate the connection with the data base, send a request and then receive the result. Authenticating the connection will involve some sort of hand shake where we pass the NWCTB a key. Once we authenticate the connection we can then send a request. A request will contain a variety of information including a location for which we want the data. Once we have sent the request we will then wait for the response and accept the data. We may also need to store this data is a data base. If this is necessary we will need an additional software interface between the database and the API.
        \end{Software Interface}

        \subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
					This project will require communication between its various parts. One key lane of communication is between the front end and back end of the application. Another key lane of communication will be between the NWCTB and our API. Most of the communication between components will be carried out through HTTP requests. These are managed by the operating system and will not effect the way our application works.
        \end{Communications Interfaces}
    \end{External Interface Requirements}

			%Decided to go with functional requirements instead of user stories because
			%it will make our Gantt Chart much easier to draft.

			\end {Functional Requirements for Front End}
    \end{Functional Requirements}

    \subsection{Performance Requirements}
				In this section we will discuss how our application needs to preform in order to fill our obligation to our client.
    \end{Performance Requirements}

    \subsection{Design Constraints}
			The constraints of this project can be divided into two parts. Software constraints and hardware constraints. In this section we will discuss these constraints.
			\subsubsection{Software Constraints}
				This project shall be implemented using Django, Angular JS and SQL databases. What we add must also be done using Django, Angular JS and SQL.
				
				Additional what we create must work with the the existing AgBizLogic system. This means we will be forced to use software interfaces and databases that have already been implemented that we have no control over. 
			\end{Software Constraints}
			
			\subsubsection{Hardware Constraints}
				Another factor that will effect how our software works is the hardware that this system is running on. The hardware this system runs on has already been determined and is managed by the university. We don't expect that the hardware will affect our project. However, we have no control over the hardware the AgBizLogic system is running on.
			\end{Hardware Constraints}
    \end{Design Constraints}

    \subsection{Other Requirements}
				This section will cover any additional information pertinent to this project but not covered in other sections.
				\subsubsection{Stretch Requirements}
				In this section we will discuss requirements not apart of our contract with our client. These goals will not be required as apart of this project but are objectives that we would like to complete.
					\paragraph{Stretch Requirement 1.1}
						Description: In requirement 2.2 instead of using two drop down menus to select the location the user would be able to use a pin on a map of the US to select their location. This would be done through an existing library that would allow us to take a pin on a map and produce a latitude and longitude.
						Dependencies: FR2.1 and FR2.2
					\end{Stretch Requirement 1.1}
				\end{Stretch Requirements}
    \end{Other Requirements}
\end {Specific Requirements}



\section{Gantt Chart}
	In this section we will have a schedule of our project based on the functional requirements section. This schedule will take into account the various dependencies on each requirement so we can implement the features in an order that allows for ease of development.
