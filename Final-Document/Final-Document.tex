        \subsection{Client Involvement}
            Clark Seavert was largely hands off during this project. However, that's not to say he didn't play a role. Clark was very helpful we reviewing documents and presentations. Clark also provided timely feed back on any change requests to the project.\\

            It is also important to note that though our project sponsor was not directly involved in the development of the short term climate tool his project manage Sean Hammond was a great resource through out the project. Through out the project we worked with Sean to work through technical problems and road blocks. Through out the term we met with Sean on a weekly basis to discuss progress on the project along with any major blockers. During these meetings Sean provided guidance on any problems we may have run into.\\

		\subsection{Overview}
			Seasonal climate is one of the essential factors that affects harvest, returns of crops and farming investment programs of enterprises and organizations. As a sub-project of AgBizLogic, AgBizClimate is dedicated to deliver essential information about climate change to farmers, and help professionals to develop management pathways that best fit their operations under a changing climate. This project aims to link the crucial seasonal climate data from the Northwest Climate Toolbox database to AgBizLogic so that it can provide specific analysis and illustrations through powerful graphics. AgBizClimate is designed to enable farmers and agriculture enterprises to decide appropriate farming investment projects for their crops and products.\\

            Currently AgBizClimate has a long-term climate tool but no such tool exists for short term climate data. We will implement a tool to extract short-term climate data from the Northwest Climate Toolbox database, display it to the user and allow the user to adjust crop yields, inputs and costs. Moreover, a landing tool will be developed to allow users to switch between short term seasonal tool and long-term climate data tool.\\

            Seasonal weather data is important for farmers and land managers as climate has great impact on crops. For instance, the precipitation on different days across the life cycles of crops may have different impacts on the harvest. Land managers and farmers used to rely on past experiences of climate to make decisions for specific farming operations to reduce the negative impacts and make use of favorable climate conditions. However, these individual experiences of weather data are often limited and inaccurate. Professional tools like software systems could be adopted to build models for decision making based on available seasonal climate data.\\

    \subsection{Project Scope}
		This project is a part of a much larger AgBiz Logic\texttrademark program. However, the purpose of this project is to add a short term climate tool to the \textit{AgBizClimate} module. This limits the scope of the project to the \textit{AgBizClimate} Module. Additionally, we will only be adding the short term climate data tool as the long term climate data tool already exists.\\



	\subsection {Product Functions}
			\textit{AgBizClimate} is a web based decision tool that will allow users to gain specific insight on how localized climate data for the next seven months will affect their crop and livestock yields or quality of products sold and production inputs. The \textit{AgBizClimate} tool will allow users to input their location (state, county) and a budget for the specific crop or livestock enterprise. \textit{AgBizClimate} will select climate data for the next seven months for that location and provide graphical data showing temperature and precipitation. Users will then be able to change yields or quality of product sold by a percentage they think these factors will affect and modify production inputs. Finally the tool will calculate the net returns.\\

	\subsection{User Characteristics}
		\textit{AgBizClimate} users can be split into two subgroups, agricultural producers and climate researchers. The first subgroup, agricultural users who use this product tend to be between fifty and sixty years old of mixed gender. Their educational background ranges from high school to the completion of college. The primary language this group uses is English, but there are some Spanish users as well. Most of the users in this group tend to have novice computational skills. The primary domain for these users is agricultural and business management. Most agricultural producers who use this product are motivated by the potential profit that the decision tool \textit{AgBizClimate} could potentially offer. The second subgroup, climate researchers range from ages twenty to forty and are of mixed gender. The educational background for most climate researchers  exceed the postgraduate level with their primary language being English. These users generally have advanced computational skills and are motivated by the easily accessible climate and weather data.\\

	\subsection{Constraints}
		There are several key constraints that this product has to work within. Firstly, We are limited by the availability and completeness of the data from the NMME data set. The NMME Data set does not have data for every point on in the country. Secondly, we must use the Threadds server hosted by University of Idaho to get the data in the NetCDF format. The tooling provides a variety of access methods however, the only method that currently works is downloading the whole file. Fourthly, we don’t have access to any of the hardware that \textit{AgBizClimate} is exists on as it is being managed by a third party. This will prevent us from improving the hardware or cause roadblocks if their servers are having issues. Lastly, we are limited to using the languages Python and JavaScript since we are integrating our product into an already existing project.\\

	\subsection {Assumptions and Dependencies}
		We are assuming that the NMME Thredds data base will allow us to pull location based temperature and precipitation data. This data will come in the form of a NetCDF files which we will then read and format a JSON response. Due to the fact that we are writing an addition to an existing project we do not need to interact with the user budgets as these have already been defined. This fact extends to the calculations portion of the \textit{AgBizClimate} product. Our team will simply be accessing data via the NMME threadds database, will then format the data, store the data, and hand the data over to the front end or some other sort of client.\\


\section{Requirements Document}
    \subsection{Original Document}
        \includepdf[pages={1-16}]{./Original-Docs/Requirements-Document-Original/AgBizClimateSRS.pdf}

    \subsection{Changes}

        \subsubsection{Introduction}
	    Through out this process some things mentioned above the introduction has changed to reflect the changes to the application. Specifically, We are no longer using NWCTB as we had originally assumed. Instead we are using a Threadds server hosted by the university of Idaho. As such we would change the references to the NWCTB to NMME Threadds database.\\

	    \subsubsection{Overall description}
	    Several things changed over the term in the overall descriptions section, constraints, and Assumptions and Dependencies. The constraints changed because we were originally thinking we were going to be required to use the NWCTB API to get the data. Instead of the NWCTB were actually constrained by the downscale NMME Threadds database hosted at University of Idaho. The assumptions and dependencies for similar reasons. We were originally assuming that we were going to need to use the NWCTB to get the data. However, because we ended using the Threadds database this introduced a slew of new dependencies including, netcdf4, the OPeNDAP protocol and HDF5.\\

	    \subsubsection{User Interface Changes}
	    Through out the process of building this application we found that there were a variety of changes were made to the UI design we originally proposed. Below we will discuss the changes we made to the UI. We will break down these changes by section as that's how it was done in the design document. Each section represents a page.\\

	        \paragraph{Landing page}
	         Originally we though we were going to use the climate manager page to branch between the different climate scenario types. We were going to do this using a button that would create a new short term climate scenario. We ended up choosing to branch a bit later in the process as it made our application simpler. As such the climate manager now only contains one button to create a new climate scenario. The climate manager also allows you to review old scenarios and to delete old scenarios. This was not functionality included in the original document.\\

	        \paragraph{New Climate Scenario Page}
	        The New Climate Scenario page design was more or less unchanged however we did not adequately describe the page in our initial requirements document. We never specified that the user would be able to add up to five budgets using this page.\\

	        \paragraph{Region Select Page}
	        Originally, the region select page was just going to be to select the region. However, early on in development we realized that if we had our user select the region and forecast scope on this page that it would simplify our work flow. So instead of just selecting state and county the user now selects climate forecast type, state and county. We also did not mention that the user will not be allow to continue with out entering all three of these items.\\

	        \paragraph{Charts Page}
	        In our initial draft of our requirements document we had planed to use a drop down menu to allow the user to select different plots that they might want to look at. We decided that it would be better to use tabs for the same functionality. So now the user may switch between different charts using tabs rather than using a drop down menu.\\

	        \paragraph{Climate Summary Page}
	        We added a new page to the User Interface description. In our original requirements document we did not know we would have a summary page, however the client already had a summary page implemented that we were able to plug the data we created in the short term tool. This page allows the user to see a summary and visual representation of what they did during their short term scenario.\\

        \subsubsection{Interfaces}
        Given that the source of our data changed we also made some changes to the hardware and software interfaces. The big change to the hardware interface is that we are now using a Threadds server located at the university of Idaho. Previously we were assuming we would be able to use the NWCTB to get the data.\\

        We also made some changes the software interface. Given that the source of our data changed several times through out the term we are no longer using the NWCTB to get our data. In fact we are now downloading the data monthly and placing in on the dev server. We are then passing the file to the container our application is run in via a mount bind. As such the software interfaces for our application changed drastically over the term. We now have to include the dev server as part of our software interface. It is also important to note that we are interfacing with the Threadds server at University of Idaho.\\

        \subsubsection{Functional Requirements changes}
            In this section we will discuss how the functional requirements have changed through out the course of the project. We will only discuss the requirements that have changed and will not discuss requirements that have not changed.\\

		    \paragraph{Functional Requirement 1.3: The data source}
		    As mentioned previously the source of the data changed from the NWCTB to the threads server hosted at University of Idaho. Additionally, the way our application uses this data changed through out the project. We were initially planning getting each data point as needed. However, we ended up storing the whole data file on the dev server.\\

		    \paragraph{Functional Requirement 1.4: Getting the Data}
		    In our original draft of the document we hadn't had a chance to look at the data yet and did not know that the data would be somewhat sparsely populated. So as the project moved along we realized that it would be possible to request a point and get NAN as a result even though it was in the middle of the data set. As such we were required to do some searching if the initial result was NAN. We eventually settled on searching with in a 20 mile radius as it was unlikely that there was not data with a 20 mile radius. We also realized that 20 miles was an acceptable margin for error.\\

		    \paragraph{Functional Requirement 1.5: Calculating Historical Data}
		    In our original document this requirement was actually sending a request for the data from the server. We swapped this requirement for calculating historic data because our client wanted to be able to see the projection vs the historical data and we are no longer making requests for the data as it is available locally.\\

		    \paragraph{Functional Requirement 1.6: Formatting the Data}
		    In our original document we were under the assumption that we would be sending a request for the data and processing the result. So this requirement changed from processing the data returned by our call to an API to formatting the data into a usable json object.\\

			This week we tried to set up a meeting with Sean to do some project planning and set up for iteration one of our project. However, Sean was unavailable this week so we set up a meeting for next week. We also got our git repo, forked from \textit{AgBiz-Logic} set up. We started planning the first iteration of development on the project by adding issues to the github repository. We also started compiling some help pages on the Wiki of our repo.\\

		\subsubsection{Week 2.2}

			\paragraph{Problems} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item API Access is less than ideal and will require more work than we were planning on but is still better than having to write our own service from scratch.
					\item Finding time to meet up as a group has been more challenging that I had anticipated.
				\end{itemize}

			\paragraph{Summary}\hfill \break
			This week we didn't get much development work done on our project like we had planed on. However, we did do some set up work. we finished setting up the github repository and finished laying out tasks on our story board. We also started defining what tasks we'd like to have in future iterations of our project. Additionally, we finally know what our API access to the climate data looks like. this will allow us to get the data we will need to plot. However, this will also require much more work that we had planned on and may set us back a bit in terms of our project schedule. That being said we worked in some flex time in to our schedule so we should be able to make it work.\\

		\subsubsection{Week 2.3}

					\item Installed netcdf.
					\item Created example script for getting climate data from the thredds database. However we get some errors on certain reads.
					\item Updated requirements document.
				\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{Problems} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item We had a hard time getting NETCDF4 to install. We ended up using anaconda however we are guessing Sean doesn't want to use Anaconda and will want us to produce an install script.\\
				\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
			This week was a primarily a week of setup. we spent most of our time trying to get the dev environment set up along with installing NETCDF4 and its dependencies. This week we did find a way to install NETCDF4 using anaconda. However, we anticipate that we will be required to find a better way to install it. In the mean time this will allow us to develop a concept script. We also managed to the development environment for AgBiz-Logic set up. This took us more time that we had anticipated but wasn't as difficult as we thought it might be. This week we also made some updates to the requirements document to reflect the changes to the climate data API.\\

		\subsubsection{week 2.4}
			\paragraph{Plans} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Start working on the front end of the application.
					\item Refine the proof of concept to be more dynamic.
					\item Write script to install netcdf and dependencies.
					\item Start working on backend changes.
					\item Update documents.
				\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{Progress} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Started working on refining proof of concept script to search for points if the point we asked for doesn't have data also added more advanced bounds checking.
					\item Determined that NETCDF4 is having issues reading in blocks for chunk three.
				\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{Problems} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item requests past index 435 on latitude cause a runtime error.
				\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
			This week was mostly focused on working on the proof of concept scrip that will be used later to access the data from the thredds server. This week we discovered that the NETCDF4 library throws errors on any lat index greater than 435. We also discovered through the database administrator that this is the boundary between chunk two and chunk three of the file we are trying to read. We think that the NETCDF4 library may have a bug in it. Regardless we are going to need to find a work around moving forward. Shane and Thomas also got together on Saturday and started working on front end changes.\\

		\subsubsection{week 2.5}
			\paragraph{Plans} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Work on front end changes.
					\item Follow up with NETCDF4 developers about potential bug.
					\item Continue to work on concept script to see if we can tease out the runtime error.
					\item Finish NETCDF5 install script.
					\item Research other potential options other than python or netcdf4 for reading in data from the serer.\\
				\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{Progress} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Followed up with netcdf4 people.
					\item Shane finished the netcdf4 install script.
					\item Researched alternatives to netcdf4 We can write a c program that will to the same thing. There are a few other libraries for reading data via opendap.
					\item made progress on frontend changes.
				\end{itemize}

			\paragraph{Problems} \hfill \break
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Issues with netcdf4 library.
					\item netcdf4 developers will not fix unless I can produce a self contained example of the read failing.
					\item We think that netcdf4 dependencies may not be installed correctly.
				\end{itemize}

			\paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
			 This week we made progress on the front end development and installing the dependencies for netcdf. However, we've run into some issues with netcdf. We think we maybe able to fix it by installing the dependencies for netcdf from source with certain flags enabled but we aren't totally sure on that. We also started work on setting up the end point where the API will live. The plan for now is to have it serve mock data as to enable us to continue with the rest of the development work without getting behind.\\

			This week was a busy week. This week we accomplished most of the front end development required by this project in the maps page. However, we also introduced some bugs. Mostly we created and issue where if you have multiple budgets its not possible to tell what page you need to redirect to once you save your budget. There are many ways we can solve this so I want to ask Sean how he thinks the best way to go about this is. This week we also made our expo poster along with creating the midterm progress report document and presentation. Additionally, Shengpei found a work around to the NETCDF problems we've been having.\\

Mainly, Now when you use multiple budgets the application correctly redirects to the correct page once reaching the end of the work flow. Shengpei also managed to get his script ported over from python 3.6 to python 2.7. Shane worked on setting up the endpoint that will evenutally host the climate data API. However, we ran into a few issues with this due to inexperience with Django.\\

			\paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
			This week we continued to make progress on the development of our application. I finished up the front end unit tests and they now all pass. Shane set up the end point and has it ready to consume the API. Shengpei finished making the updates to the API so that the front end can easily consume the data. All that is left to do is to put the pieces together and fix any bugs we've created in the process. Next week we should be able to put the pieces together and produce a fully functioning beta release.\\

			\paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
			This week we took all the pieces that we already had done and put them together. We found a few issues with the climate API and fixed them. Shane integrated the climate data end point with the climate data API. I then used that end point to get dynamically generated data on the front end. Thus we now have a fully functional beta.\\

		    \paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
		    This week our team decided to take it a bit easier as we don't have tons of work left to do and every one in our group is sick. So we didn't meet up and do a ton work this week but we did do some planning for our document projects along with creating some issues in github. Next week we will meet up and come up with a plan for finishing this project by the middle of the term.\\

		            \item Worked on diagnosis for issues with script to get data.\\
		            \item Started researching alternative solutions for getting data.\\
		        \end{itemize}
		    \paragraph{Problems} \hfill \break
		        \begin{itemize}
		            \item Currently our API isn't returning any data and is hanging indefinitely. I'm not sure if the URL changed or if something changed about the was data access works but currently our method of accessing data does not work.\\
		            \item Found that our current solution isn't stable and isn't going to work out. So we need to find a new solution for getting the data from the Threadds server.\\
		        \end{itemize}
		    \paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
		    This week I went to do some testing and discovered that the climate API wasn't working. I started looking into why it wasn't working correctly and we also met as a group to discuss why the API is hanging. As a group we determined that this solution though clever is not stable. We will need to create a new solution from scratch probably from matlab as this is what the server admin recommended. The idea is that we will use the matlab scrip to get the data. We will call this script from a python script. This is possible because matlab provides extensive support for python.\\

		\subsubsection{Week 3.3}
		    \paragraph{Plans} \hfill \break
		        \begin{itemize}
		            \item Write Matlab API or figure out alternative wat to get data from database.\\
		            \item If we solve data issues start writing tests for backend code.\\
		            \item Add hoc testing.
		        \end{itemize}
		    \paragraph{Progress} \hfill \break
		        \begin{itemize}
		            \item Started working on alternate data API.
		            \item Found that MatLab was not going to work out as it was going to be hard to virtualize along with the fact that we can't export the interpreter.\\
		            \item Tried R implimentation and discovered that R has the same problem as the python version.\\
		            \item Meet with Sean to come up with a better solution for Accessing the data. We decied we will have to produce a chron job that gets the data every month and we will then spin that data into a mongodb database.\\
		        \end{itemize}
		    \paragraph{Problems} \hfill \break
		        \begin{itemize}
		            \item Currently our API doesn't return and hangs indefinitely. We were previously accessing the data using a URL method. We've tested this method and determined its the database we are connecting to that is hanging.
		            \item The underlying C library for the NETCDF library we are using has a bug in it or the server we are connecting to is set up incorrectly. Either way we are not going to be able to depend on this library to read files over the network.\\
		        \end{itemize}
		    \paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
		        This week we started looking for a solution to our data API problems. We discovered that matlab was not going to be a viable solution as it is impossible to virtualize along with the fact that exporting the interpreter is impossible. We also tried an R version of the same thing and were able to get the up and running but we get the same errors as the python library. In the end we are stuck downloading the whole file and storing it on the local server every month.\\

		        \begin{itemize}
		            \item Started working on creating database script.\\
		            \item Decided to abandon the idea of using DB all together and decided to use mount bind to share directory between the os and the container.\\

		        \end{itemize}
		    \paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
		        This week we entertained the solution of using mongodb to store our climate database. However, after some research and thinking about the problem we decided that the best solution was really just to use a mount bind to share a directory between the os and container. We also started working on getting a proof of concept up for this solution. We have run into some issues getting rkt to run a docker image.\\
		\subsubsection{Week 3.5}
		    \paragraph{Plans} \hfill \break

		        \end{itemize}
		    \paragraph{Summary} \hfill \break
		        This week we made alot of progress on the API. Most of this week development efforts were directed at the API. We managed to rewrite the API so that it uses a local netcdf file containing the climate data. Additionally the location of this file is provided through a configuration file so that it can be set differently for prod vs dev. The API has also been set to handle if the file doesn't exist with out throwing exception's. Finally, we will also set up the API to deal with searching the data when it finds a point that does not have a value. If no data can be found with in the nearest 99 locations then an error will be returned.\\

%We will put set up and configuration steps here. We will also discuss how our project works. Hardware and software requirements. User guids, API Docs.
% This section should cover:
% How does your project work?
%   What is its structure?
%   What is its theory of Operation?
%   Block flow and diagrams are good here.
%
% How does one install your software?
% How does one run your software?
% Are there any special run time requirements to run your software?
% Any user guides, API documentation etc.
%This needs to be detailed enough to recreate and/or use your project.
\section{Project Documentation}
    \subsection{Essential Documents}


    %This section will need to cover What websites were helpful?
    %What, if any, reference books really helped?
    %were there any people on campus that were really helpful?
    \subsection{Recommended Technical Resources}
        \subsubsection{Helpful web pages}

        \subsubsection{Helpful people on campus}
            \paragraph{Seam Hammond} Sean Hammond is our Clients technical adviser. When ever we ran into problems we weren't sure how to solve Sean was always our go to as he is very familiar with the project and the frame works used on the project.\\

            \paragraph{Rob Hess} Rob Hess is an instructor here on campus. He teaches web development, mobile development, cloud development and many other courses. During spring term Thomas and Shane were taking Rob's could development class where we were learning about vitalization. One of the problems we faced in this project was related to the best way to handle a vitalization problem at a design level. After coming up with a few ideas were able to run these by Rob and confirm that we were  using best practice for our problem.\\

            \paragraph{Graham Barber} Graham is a coworker of Thomas's at CASS here on campus. One day we were stuck on a docker compatibility issue with rocket and Graham was very helpful in helping us work through this issue. Graham has had some experience with rocket and was able to point us to some documentation that solved our problem.

            \paragraph{Zach Lerew} Zach Lerew is another one of Thomas's coworkers at CASS. Zach Lerew has had some experience with Django through work done at CASS. As a result when faced with some Django problems we were able to ask Zach for some help when facing issues that the documentation couldn't answer.\\

%This section should cover the following:
% What Technical information did you learn?
% What non-technical information did you learn?
% what have you learned about project work?
% what have learned about project management?
% what have you learned about working in teams?
% If you could do this all over again what would you do differently?

\section{Conclusions and Reflections}

    \subsection{Shane Barrantes}
        Over the course of this project I learned a lot about the following technologies.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Django:} I learned how the front-end, back-end, and unit tests work as well as how to add Routes and API Routes.
            \item \textbf{AngularJS:} I learned basic front-end information about angularJS and got a little bit of insight to how it's often tested.
            \item \textbf{Rkt:} I learned the limitations of pulling down containers and how to implement bind mounts.
            \item \textbf{NetCDF:} I learned what NetCDF, it's installation process, how to interact with files, and fairly deep understanding of the functionality.
            \item \textbf{Github:} I learned how to work in a team environment, how to squash merge conflicts, and how to re-base.
            \item \textbf{DevOps:} I learned about the deployment process for our project and gained some software building insights.
        \end{itemize}

        As far as non-technical information I learned how to frequently communicate with clients and how to work together in a team environment. I also learned how to work independently on a team project.

        I don't think I learned a whole lot about project work that I hadn't already experienced in a work or internship environment. One thing that stands out is time management while working with a team that has very different active hours than you do. Another thing I learned was how to regularly communicate the work progress directly to the client since.

        The project management skills I learned over the duration of this project mostly reside in inter-team communication and team scheduling. We frequently setup goals and deadlines that were in flux based on our term schedules, project state, and deadlines.

        The most important things I learned about working in teams are communication and of how to divide the work based on skills, availability, and fairness.

        If I could do this all over again I would look for an alternative solution for our client data API immediately. We took the client specification and tried our best to make it work, however this added months of work on tools and software that in the end were not used in the final product. If we were aware of our final solution sooner, we would have easily been able to do more testing and implement stretch goals.



    \subsection{Thomas Noelcke}
        While working on the project I learned about the following technologies.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Django:} I learned about how to set up and configure a django application. Additionally, I also learned how views and API views work in Django. I also learned about unit testing in Django.\\
            \item \textbf{AngularJS:} I learned how to implement a thick client in Angular js. This includes building the dom, routing, sending requests to the API and passing data from one view to another.\\
            \item \textbf{postgres SQL:} I learned a few of the differences between postgres and mysql.\
            \item \textbf{NETCDF:} I learned what NETCDF files are and how to read in and interact with netcdf files. I also learned how to install and setup the netcdf package in python.\\
            \item \textbf{github:} I learned about managing projects via github using issues along with a project board in github. I also learned about the feature branch work flow process.\\
            \item \textbf{git:} I learned how to use git to rebase branches. I also learned how to use the command line client to view history and move the project thorugh different points in the history of the project.\\
            \item \textbf{Ubuntu:} I learned how to install and setup Ubuntu. I also learned how to set up and install projects on Ubuntu. I learned about the apt-get package manager and how to use to manage various different software packages.\\
            \item \textbf{Rocket:}
            \item \textbf{Devops:}
        \end{itemize}



    \subsection{Shengpei Yuan}
			After finished project, I have learned several new skills.
			\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Python:} I learned the difference between python 2.7 and 3, and used python to get data from climate website by modify parameter URL.
					\item \textbf{Django:} I learned unit tests, front-end and back-end.
					\item \textbf{NetCDF:} I learned how to install NetCDF and how it works with other files.
			\end{itemize}

			For the non-technical information, I have learned how to work and cooperate with teammate, and how to communicate with client when meet problem.
			After overviewed the project, I have learned the way using past climate data to predict the future yield of corps and understood the value of past climate data.
			For the project management, I have understood that plan ahead and finish task on schedule are very important because a complete project is the primary goal for the project management.
			For the team work, I have learned that communication is very important for the team and how to keep communication with group member.
			If I could do the project again, I would like to find more climate data sources and build a better data API to ensure project can get data anytime.
