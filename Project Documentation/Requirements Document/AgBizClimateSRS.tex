		\subsection{Overview}
			Seasonal climate is one of the essential factors that affects agricultural production. As a module of \textit{AgBiz Logic}, \textit{AgBizClimate} delivers essential information about climate change to farmers, and help professionals to develop management pathways that best fit their operations under a changing climate. This project aims to link the seasonal climate data from the NMME data set to \textit{AgBiz Logic} so that it can provide changes in net returns of crop and livestock enterprises through powerful graphics and tables. \\
			Currently \textit{AgBizClimate} has a long-term climate tool but no such tool exists for short term climate data. We will implement a tool to extract short-term climate data from the NMME data set, display it to the user and allow the user to adjust crop and livestock yields or quality of products sold and, production inputs. Moreover, a landing tool will be developed to allow users to switch between short-term seasonal tool and long-term climate data tool.\\
\section{Overall Description}
	\subsection {Product Functions}
				\textit{AgBizClimate} is a web based decision tool that will allow users to gain specific insight on how localized climate data for the next seven months will affect their crop and livestock yields or quality of products sold and production inputs. The \textit{AgBizClimate} tool will allow users to input their location (state, county) and a budget for the specific crop or livestock enterprise. \textit{AgBizClimate} will select climate data for the next seven months for that location and provide graphical data showing temperature and precipitation. Users will then be able to change yields or quality of product sold by a percentage they think these factors will affect and modify production inputs. Finally the tool will calculate the net returns.\\

	\subsection{User Characteristics}
		\textit{AgBizClimate} users can be split into two subgroups, agricultural producers and climate researchers. The first subgroup, agricultural users who use this product tend to be between fifty and sixty years old of mixed gender. Their educational background ranges from high school to the completion of college. The primary language this group uses is English, but there are some Spanish users as well. Most of the users in this group tend to have novice computational skills. The primary domain for these users is agricultural and business management. Most agricultural producers who use this product are motivated by the potential profit that the decision tool \textit{AgBizClimate} could potentially offer. The second subgroup, climate researchers range from ages twenty to forty and are of mixed gender. The educational background for most climate researchers  exceed the postgraduate level with their primary language being English. These users generally have advanced computational skills and are motivated by the easily accessible climate and weather data.\\

	\subsection{Constraints}
		There are several key constraints that this product has to work within. Firstly, We are limited by the availability and completeness of the data from the NMME data set. The NMME Data set does not have data for every point on in the country. Secondly, we must use the Threadds server hosted by University of Idaho to get the data in the NetCDF format. The tooling provides a variety of access methods however, the only method that currently works is downloading the whole file. Fourthly, we don’t have access to any of the hardware that \textit{AgBizClimate} is exists on as it is being managed by a third party. This will prevent us from improving the hardware or cause roadblocks if their servers are having issues. Lastly, we are limited to using the languages Python and JavaScript since we are integrating our product into an already existing project.\\

	\subsection {Assumptions and Dependencies}
		We are assuming that the NMME Thredds data base will allow us to pull location based temperature and precipitation data. This data will come in the form of a NetCDF files which we will then read and format a JSON response. Due to the fact that we are writing an addition to an existing project we do not need to interact with the user budgets as these have already been defined. This fact extends to the calculations portion of the \textit{AgBizClimate} product. Our team will simply be accessing data via the NMME threadds database, will then format the data, store the data, and hand the data over to the front end or some other sort of client.\\

\section{Specific Requirements}
This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the \textit{AgBizClimate} System. We will give detailed description of what's being added to the \textit{AgBiz Logic} system along with the features we will implement.\\
    \subsection{External Interface Requirements}
		This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the short term climate tool for the \textit{AgBizClimate} system. This section will also provide descriptions for the hardware, software and communication interfaces. Additionally we will provide detailed prototypes for the user interface for the short term climate data tool.\\
        \subsubsection{User Interface}
					When the user first navigates to \textit{AgBizClimate} from the \textit{AgBiz Logic} main page the user will be directed to a climate manager. The climate manager will allow the user to create new climate scenarios, view old scenarios and delete scenarios. On this page there will also be a brief description of the tool and what does. This description will also describe the difference between the long term climate data tool and the short term data climate tool. Below this description will be a button that will start the process of creating a new long term climate scenario. Clicking this button will take you to the page where you will add budgets to the scenario along with giving the scenario and adding notes to the scenario. For a prototype of this page please see \ref{ref:FigTab} Figures and Tables figure \ref{figure3.1}.\\

					After clicking the button to create a new climate scenario will take you to the new climate scenario page. On this page the user will be able to give the scenario a name and make some notes about this page. From this page the user will also be able to add budgets to the climate scenario. They will be able to add up to five budgets to a single scenario. Once the user has given the scenario a name, made some notes and added some budgets they will click the next button. The next button will take them to the region select page. For a prototype of this page please see \ref{ref:FigTab} Figures and Tables figure \ref{figure3.2}.\\

					Once the user Selects their budgets, makes notes on the scenario and clicks continue the will be redirected to a page where they will be prompted to enter their location and to choose a climate scope. For the climate scope they will be able to choose between the short term and the long term climate scopes. The scope will be selected using a drop down. This page will also take a county and a sate as input. This page will have a drop down menu for the state and the county. Before the user can enter a County they will be forced to enter a state. Once a state is entered the county drop down menu will auto populate and the user will be allowed to enter a county. For a prototype of this page see section \ref{ref:FigTab} Figures and Tables figure \ref{figure3.3}.\\

					After clicking continue the user will be taken to the plots for the location they selected. This page will initially have the 7 month average precipitation plot selected as the default. However, the user can select from four options via a drop down menu. Changing what is selected in the drop down menu will change which plot is displayed. Once the user has reviewed the plots they can then enter in how much they think their yield will be effected based on the climate data. For a prototype of this page see section \ref{ref:FigTab} Figures and Tables figure \ref{figure3.4}.\\
					
					Next the user will be directed to the budget review page. This page will display a summary of the budget. The summary of the budget will include Income, General Cash Costs and A total summary of the budget. This page will allow the user to adjust the cost per unit, input costs, and quantity sold and will adjust their budget in near real time. This page will also allow the user to remove or add inputs to their general costs. This page will also allow the user to save their budget and output it as a PDF. For a prototype of this page see \ref{ref:FigTab} Figures and Tables figure \ref{figure3.5}.\\
					

        \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
					This project requires no designed hardware and the hardware this system is running on is managed by the Operating system as a result no hardware interfaces are necessary. Additionally the connection to the NMME data set is managed over the network and requires no hardware interface.\\

        \subsubsection{Software Interface}
					There are several software interfaces in this application, one between the back end and the front end, one between the back end and the Database and finally a software interface between our RESTFUl API and the NMME data set. The majority of the connections between the front end and the back end are managed for us the the current \textit{AgBiz Logic} system. However, we will still need to connect our API to the back end to provide the data from the NMME data set. To make this connection we will use a RESTFULL API. This will allow for the back end code to make a direct call to our API to extract the data.\\
					We will also need a connection between the NMME data set and our API. For our API we know we will be using OPeNDAP, a network level protocol, to make the connection between the Thredds database that the NMME data is stored in. OPeNDAP will form the software interface between our API and the Thredds database. We will be able to format our request using query parameters in the URL.\\

        \subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
					This project will require communication between its various parts. One key lane of communication is between the front end and back end of the application. The communication between the front end and back end will be carried out via HTTP. Another key lane of communication will be between the Thredds data base containing the NMME data set and our API. This lane of communication will be carried out using OPeNDAP which is a network later protocol based on HTTP. These are managed by the operating system and are widely used through out the industry so we will not discuss how they work.\\


		\subsection{Functional Requirements}
			In this Section we will list and discuss the functional requirements for this project. Each functional requirement shall have an ID, Title, Description and Dependencies. The ID shall be unique for each requirement. The description will give a detailed expiation of the requirement. The dependencies section will list the requirements that will need to be complete before starting work on that requirement.\\

    \subsection{Performance Requirements}
    	In this section we will list the performance metrics for our application. This performance metrics will describe acceptable performance for our application. Each requirement will have a title and a description that provides details for how that metric will be measured.
				\subsubsection{Performance Metric 1}
               	\textbf{Title:} Run Time Performance \hfill \break
                Our application shall provide the plotted data in a reasonable amount of time 100 percent of the time. Reasonable being defined as less than 5 seconds. This time shall be measured from the time the user presses the next button after selecting their state and county to the time the web page is loaded with the plot being displayed.\\
                \subsubsection{Performance Metric 2}
                \textbf{Title:} Reliability \hfill \break
                Our application shall provide the correct result to the user 100 percent of the time. This result can include an error if the user enters a location that doesn't exist or if the data the user request is unavailable.\\

    \subsection{Design Constraints}
			The constraints of this project can be divided into two parts. Software constraints and hardware constraints. In this section we will discuss these constraints.\\
			\subsubsection{Software Constraints}
				This project shall be implemented using Django, Angular JS and SQL databases. What we add must also be done using Django, Angular JS and SQL.\\

				Additionally, what we create must work with the the existing \textit{AgBiz Logic} system. This means we will be forced to use software interfaces and databases that have already been implemented that we have no control over.\\

			\subsubsection{Hardware Constraints}
				Another factor that will effect how our software works is the hardware that this system is running on. The hardware this system runs on has already been determined and is managed by the university. We don't expect that the hardware will affect our project. However, we have no control over the hardware the \textit{AgBiz Logic} system is running on.\\

    \subsection{Other Requirements}
				This section will cover any additional information pertinent to this project but not covered in other sections.\\
				\subsubsection{Stretch Requirements}
				In this section we will discuss requirements not apart of our contract with our client. These goals will not be required as apart of this project but are objectives that we would like to complete.\\
					\paragraph{Stretch Requirement 1.1}
						\textbf{ID: SR1.1}\hfill \break
						Title: Location Via a Map \hfill \break
						Description: In requirement 2.2 instead of using two drop down menus to select the location the user would be able to use a pin on a map of the US to select their location. This would be done through an existing library that would allow us to take a pin on a map and produce a latitude and longitude.\\
						Dependencies: FR2.1 and FR2.2\\
						
						\paragraph{Stretch Requirement 1.2}
							\textbf{ID: SR1.2}\hfill \break
							Title: Using Many models to calculate plot data \hfill \break
							Description: When requesting the model data we shall request many different climate models. We shall then run some statistical calculations on the data. These calculations shall create a 90\% confidence interval. This data will then be used to display the 90\% confidence interval to our users to indicate when there is uncertainty about what will happen.
							Dependencies: FR1.1, FR1.2, FR1.3, FR1.4, FR1.5 and FR 2.1
