					 The purpose of this document is to give a snap shot of the current state of the project. In this progress report will start off by discussing ToDo's we have resolved. We will then move on to items that are in progress. After that we will discuss what is still left to do on the project. Next we will give a week by week summary of our progress including our plans for each week, what we accomplished, problems we encountered and a summery for the week.

\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
		The purpose of this document is to describe the progress we have made so far on the \textit{AgBizClimate} project. In this document we will give a brief introduction to the \textit{AgBizCliamte} project. In this section we will discuss the purpose of the project. Additionally, we will also discuss the scope of the project and an overview of the project functions.\\
		This document is designed for the project owners. This document is also designed for the development team so we can evaluate our progress so far on this project. This project is also designed to fulfill the minimum requirements for the CS461 class for the OSU computer science program.\\

				\subsection{Overview}
			Seasonal climate is one of the essential factors that affects agricultural production. As a module of \textit{AgBiz Logic}, \textit{AgBizClimate} delivers essential information about climate change to farmers, and help professionals to develop management pathways that best fit their operations under a changing climate. This project aims to link the crucial seasonal climate data from the Northwest Climate Toolbox database to \textit{AgBiz Logic} so that it can provide changes in net returns of crop and livestock enterprises through powerful graphics and tables.\\

		\subsection{Scope}
			This project is a part of a much larger AgBiz Logic\texttrademark program. However, the purpose of this project is to add a short term climate tool to the \textit{AgBizClimate} module. This limits the scope of the project to the \textit{AgBizClimate} Module. Additionally, we will only be adding the short term climate data tool as the long term climate data tool already exists.\\

			Currently \textit{AgBizClimate} has a long-term climate tool but no such tool exists for short term climate data. We will implement a tool to extract short-term climate data from the Northwest Climate Toolbox database, display it to the user and allow the user to adjust crop and livestock yields or quality of products sold and, production inputs. Moreover, a landing tool will be developed to allow users to switch between short-term seasonal tool and long-term climate data tool.\\

		\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
			REST - Representational State Transfer, This is a type of architecture that manages the state of the program. This is especially popular in web development.\\
			API- Application Programming Interface. This is a piece of software that allows a connection to another piece of software providing some sort of service.\\
			NWCTB - Northwest Climate Toolbox. This is the database we will be connecting to that will provide the short term climate data we plan to use.\\
			Thredds Data Server - This is a web server that provides meta-data and data access for scientific data sets using OPeNDAP along with some other remote data access protocols.\\
			OPeNDAP - Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol. This is the protocol we will be using to retrieve the data sets from the Thredds data server.\\
			NMME - North American Multi-Model Ensemble. This is a data set that brings together a variety of different weather models into one data set.\\
			Climate Scenario - This is a theoretical calculation of yields, inputs and of the overall budget for one situation based on the climate data.\\
			NETCDF - This is a file storage format for large scientific data sets especially good for any data that is referenced on a grid and related to is geo-location.\\


		%will need updates.
		\subsection{Product Function Overview}
		    \textit{AgBizClimate} is a web based decision tool that will allow users to gain specific insight on how localized climate data for the next seven months will affect their crop and livestock yields or quality of products sold and production inputs. The \textit{AgBizClimate} tool will allow users to input their location (state, county) and a budget for the specific crop or livestock enterprise. \textit{AgBizClimate} will select climate data for the next seven months for that location and provide graphical data showing temperature and precipitation. Users will then be able to change yields or quality of product sold by a percentage they think these factors will affect and modify production inputs. Finally the tool will calculate the net returns.\\

\section{Current Project State}
    In this section of this document we will review what items we have resolved, List and explain what items we still have to do, discuss major blockers and give a week by week summary of what we have done so far. This section is intended to give a good overall picture of the status of the \textit{AgBizClimate} project along with what we have accomplished so far.\\

	\subsection{Resolved Items}
		\subsubsection{Create Data Access Tool In R}
		
		\subsubsection{Update Expo Poster}
		
		\subsubsection{Produce Proof of Concept for Rocket Mount Bind}
		
		\subsubsection{Write Script for Chron Job}

	\subsection{In progress}
		%not sure weather I'll have this done by the end of the week...
		\subsubsection{Rewrite API to use local file provided through a Mount Bind}
		
		%Unit testing maybe?
		
		%manual testing maybe?
		
	\subsection{ToDo's}
	
		\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
		
		\subsubsection{Manual Testing}
		
		\subsubsection{Bug Fixes}
		
		\subsubsection{Document Updates}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Requirements Document} - Update requirements to reflect most recent changes to the project over the last development cycle.
				\item \textbf{Design Document} - Update design document to reflect design as build.
				\item \textbf{Tech Review} - Update tech review to reflect the technology we actually chose to use.
			\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Blockers}
	    In this section we will discuss hurtles we are facing that are impeding progress on this project. We will discuss why they will keep us from moving forward on this project and we will also discuss what we intend to do to move past these problems.\\
			
			\subsubsection{Threadds Server Issues} Through out this project we were required to connect to a threadds server managed at Idaho State University. We've found that all of the various implementations of the NETCDF4 library have the same underlying c library. This c library doesn't work over the network on clunked files. This means that either the Library wasn't made to be used over the network or that there is a serious by in regards to chunked files. This has significantly impeded our progress this term as we've created several implementations of our API with this library to see if we could find a version that would work over the network.\\


\section{Weekly summary of progress}
	   In this section we will give a weekly summary of our progress on this project. For each we will list out our plans, problems we have encountered during the week and will show a summery of what we have accomplished during the week.\\
